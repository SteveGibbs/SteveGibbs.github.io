  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="style3">
    I'm Steve Gibbs, a full stack web developer based in Sydney.  I enjoy the intellectual challenge of problem solving and building a product that users can interact with.  It is extremely satisfying to see users' reactions to websites I have built.  I have deep subject matter expertise in banking and finance, having worked in many roles from front to back, with substantial experience in the implementation of new products and new systems.  With strong numeracy skills and experience in decomposing and managing problems, I am seeking new challenges where I can make a substantial contribution to your business.

        predicated on reducing food wastage in society. Corporate donors, such as restaurants, cafes and supermarkets, via a login, donate excess food which is then redistributed to refuges, the homeless and the needy. The charity also has a gift shop
        with shopping cart functionality, without login. And there is administrative access to view orders via live polling with AJAX requests and to have sales charts, via Chart.js, that live update.

        for boutique watches and accessories. Highlights include a shopping cart with payment functionality via Stripe and receipt confirmations emailed to users. Live order polling via AJAX and webscraping of competitor websites for the administrator
        to monitor opposition prices via Nokogiri. </p>

        users and administrators, as well as incorporate a couple of API's. Users navigate from country to associated cities and to associated tours that can belong to many cities or users. Incorporates a search menu on landing page to auto-navigate to
        selected option, display of current weather for city chosen and ability to see tours booked.</p>

         for my week 3 project, tic tac toe.  Code was intentionally written in javascript, with no jQuery, to better build my fundamentals and syntax of the language.  Game has two player mode or you can play against the computer (random AI).  You have the ability to select between four themes: classic tic tac toe (X vs O), Presidential - Hillary vs Trump, Day of the Dead (Mexican Day of the Dead Female Skull vs Male Skull) or Space (Roiling Sun vs Moon gifs).  Player scoreboard and reset functionality.</p>
